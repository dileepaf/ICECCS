\section{EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS}
Experiments are based on the example mechanism presented in section \ref{ssec:ex}. Exact same mechanism is tested for running time and memory performance for different numbers of players and different Byzantine set sizes. In all cases $\epsilon=0.01$ and $\delta=0.005$. Experiments were run in 64-bit x-86 Intel machine having 2.40 GHz processor with 8GB RAM.
