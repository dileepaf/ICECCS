\section{MOTIVATION}
One research problem in game like protocols/systems is the need to find a most efficient representation for the analysis of game theoretic properties. Designing new modelling language constructs to automatically generate the game representation by the system model is highly essential.  Another research problem is finding verification and synthesis algorithms based on the representation. If proposed algorithms are time consuming, approximate algorithms can be introduced.\newline
We consider verifying the rationality of finite state concurrent systems. We restrict our analysis to extensive games with prefect information. To be more general, we would assume the system/protocol choices be probabilistic.
