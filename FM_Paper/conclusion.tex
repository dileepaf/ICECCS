\section{CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK}
We presented a model checking algorithm  to verify Nash Equilibrium in deterministic, probabilistic protocols in finite state concurrent systems. We specify such protocols as probabilistic finite automata and verify $\epsilon-f-Nash$\cite{MMS08} by using the proposed algorithm. We evaluated the applicability of the protocol with a case study about randomized secret sharing protocol\cite{HT04} and presented the experimental results via a continuous task sharing scenario.\newline

As future work, we will support non-deterministic protocols with the presence of probabilistic actions (Markov Decision Processes). We also plan to develop a tool to convert a finite state concurrent system specification to a game with the least involvement of the designer.
